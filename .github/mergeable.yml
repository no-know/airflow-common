            Title should follow conventional commit format `type(scope): summary`
            - type is one of feat, fix, refactor, revert, ci, build, docs, chore
            - scope is optional, it can be a Jira ticket reference or anything else, e.g. feat(jira-123) or build(deps)
            - summary should start with lower case and shouldn't end with punctuation
      - do: description

            Description should not be empty. Please provide details with **what** was changed, **why** it was changed, and **how** it was changed.
